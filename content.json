    "email_content": "Dear Sir,\n\nI am writing to express serious concerns regarding the candidacy of Mr. Imran Khan for the Chancellor election at Oxford.\n• Supporting extremism, Mr. Khan proposed allowing the “Taliban to open an office” in Pakistan, sparking widespread criticism.\n• He referred to the Taliban as “freedom fighters” and celebrated the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan as Afghans \"breaking the shackles of slavery.\"\n• Mr. Khan referred to “Osama bin Laden” as a \"shaheed\" (martyr), honoring his death instead of condemning his actions.\n• Mr. Khan blamed clothing of women for incidents of rape, shifting blame away from perpetrators.\n• Allegations against Mr. Khan include a “sex scandal” and mobilizing an online troll army to harass Hajra Khan who accused him of rape.\n• Mr. Khan was convicted in the Toshakhana (Govt Treasury) case for the illegal sale of state gifts and has been involved in a legal battle over his refusal to acknowledge his daughter, “Tyrian White”.\nOxford is urged to consider these serious concerns before electing Mr. Khan as Chancellor.\n\nRegards",
